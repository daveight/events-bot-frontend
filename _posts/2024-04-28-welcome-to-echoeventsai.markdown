Welcome to EchoEventsAI, your one-stop destination for event subscriptions on Telegram! Our Telegram bot allows you to easily subscribe to the events you like, so you never miss out on any important updates or happenings.

## How It Works

EchoEventsAI makes it easy for you to discover and subscribe to events that match your interests. Here's how it works:

1. **Select Event Type**: At the first step, customers select the type of events they are interested in. Whether it's concerts, workshops, conferences, sports events, or any other type, simply specify your preferences to get started.

2. **Provide Preferences**: Next, customers need to provide a free-text description of their preferences. For example, if you're interested in music events, you can specify your favorite artists, music styles, or genres. Here's a concrete example: "I enjoy indie rock music, especially bands like Arctic Monkeys and The Strokes."

3. **Choose Cities**: After specifying their preferences, customers select the cities they are looking for events in. Whether it's their current city or places they frequently visit, selecting the right cities ensures that they receive relevant event recommendations.

4. **Set Preferences for Recommendations**: Finally, customers specify their openness to receiving new recommendations and how frequently they want to get updates. For example, they can choose to receive daily or weekly updates, and indicate whether they're open to discovering new events outside their specified preferences.
